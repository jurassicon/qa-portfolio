# Checklists

## Snake — Smoke checklist
- [ ] Game starts without errors
- [ ] Snake moves
- [ ] Arrow-key controls work
- [ ] Apple spawns
- [ ] Eating apple increases length
- [ ] Wrap-around works on all sides
- [ ] Self-collision triggers Game Over (text/sound)

## Game QA — quick sanity checklist (mobile/desktop)
- [ ] Start/restart works reliably
- [ ] Core loop stays stable after 5–10 minutes
- [ ] No soft-lock (can’t continue)
- [ ] Input does not lead to illegal states (spam / command queue)
- [ ] Edge cases covered (borders, fast state changes)
